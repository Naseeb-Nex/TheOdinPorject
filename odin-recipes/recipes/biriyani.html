        Hyderabadi Biryani is characteristically distinct. The aroma, taste, tender meat, 
        the Zaffran, everything gives it a distinguished appearance. Those who have tasted 
        Lucknow Biryani may find Hyderabadi a bit familiar. Both biryanis belonged to the 
        Mughal regime, yet down south the food is laced with local spices.
